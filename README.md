# Lab 2 — Production-Grade RAG Infrastructure

This repository is **Lab 2** in a two-part sequence.

- Lab 1: Secure single-node Weaviate fundamentals  
- Lab 2 (this repository): Build a multi-service Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot using Weaviate, Ollama, FastAPI, NGINX, and Gradio.

You will not just run a chatbot, you will understand how it is built, secured, and operated.

---

# What You Will Build

By the end of this lab, you will have:

- A private vector database (Weaviate)
- A validated ingestion API
- A local LLM (Ollama) generating grounded answers
- An authentication gateway (NGINX)
- A browser-based chat UI
- A cybersecurity-focused dataset powering retrieval

The system is intentionally layered and secured to resemble real-world deployments.

# Important

The README only helps you start the system.

To understand:

- Why Weaviate is internal-only  
- Why NGINX enforces an API key  
- How retrieval works  
- How the prompt is constructed  
- How Ollama is called  
- How the services communicate
