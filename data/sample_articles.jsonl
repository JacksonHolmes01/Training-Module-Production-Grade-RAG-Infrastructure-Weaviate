{"title": "CIA Triad: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability", "url": "https://example.org/cyber/cia-triad", "source": "Lab2-Cyber-Notes", "published_date": "2026-02-13", "text": "The CIA triad is a basic model for information security. Confidentiality means only authorized people or systems can access data. Integrity means data remains accurate and cannot be changed without detection. Availability means systems and data remain accessible when needed. Security controls often involve trade-offs across these three goals depending on the system and its risks."}
{"title": "Defense in Depth: Layered Controls", "url": "https://example.org/cyber/defense-in-depth", "source": "Lab2-Cyber-Notes", "published_date": "2026-02-13", "text": "Defense in depth means using multiple layers of security controls so a single failure does not compromise the system. Layers can include network segmentation, an edge proxy, application authentication, input validation, least privilege, and monitoring. In this lab, NGINX checks an API key before requests reach the API, and the FastAPI app checks it again (defense in depth)."}
{"title": "Authentication vs Authorization (and RBAC)", "url": "https://example.org/cyber/authn-authz-rbac", "source": "Lab2-Cyber-Notes", "published_date": "2026-02-13", "text": "Authentication answers 'Who are you?' Authorization answers 'What are you allowed to do?' Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) groups permissions into roles so you can grant consistent access without managing every permission individually. In multi-service systems, enforce authorization at boundaries such as the gateway and API so internal services are not exposed directly."}
{"title": "Why Exposing Databases Directly Is Risky", "url": "https://example.org/cyber/why-not-expose-db", "source": "Lab2-Cyber-Notes", "published_date": "2026-02-13", "text": "Databases are typically not safe to expose as public-facing interfaces. Direct exposure increases attack surface, can bypass validation and rate limiting, and makes credential management harder. A safer pattern is to keep databases on private networks and expose a controlled API that enforces authentication, validation, and logging. In this lab, Weaviate stays internal and the edge proxy + API form the public boundary."}
{"title": "Input Validation and Data Hygiene", "url": "https://example.org/cyber/input-validation", "source": "Lab2-Cyber-Notes", "published_date": "2026-02-13", "text": "Input validation checks that incoming data matches expected formats before storing or processing it. Validation reduces accidental errors and helps prevent security issues caused by malformed inputs. Common checks include required fields, type checks, length limits, and URL validation. For RAG systems, data hygiene also improves retrieval quality, which improves chatbot reliability."}
{"title": "Supply Chain Risk in AI Pipelines", "url": "https://example.org/cyber/supply-chain-risk", "source": "Lab2-Cyber-Notes", "published_date": "2026-02-13", "text": "Supply chain risk comes from third-party components such as libraries, container images, datasets, and external services. Risks include vulnerable dependencies, compromised images, and poisoned datasets. Mitigations include pinning versions, scanning dependencies, verifying image sources, limiting privileges, and monitoring. In ingestion pipelines, validate and normalize data before storing it."}
{"title": "Secrets Management Basics (.env and Rotation)", "url": "https://example.org/cyber/secrets-management", "source": "Lab2-Cyber-Notes", "published_date": "2026-02-13", "text": "Secrets include API keys and passwords. In local projects, .env files help keep secrets out of source code, but .env should never be committed to GitHub. In production, secrets are stored in secret managers and rotated. Least exposure means only services that need a secret should receive it."}
{"title": "Logging and Monitoring for Incident Response", "url": "https://example.org/cyber/logging-monitoring", "source": "Lab2-Cyber-Notes", "published_date": "2026-02-13", "text": "Logs and monitoring help you understand what a system is doing and why it failed. Useful logs include authentication failures, validation errors, dependency connection failures, and startup errors. Metrics can include request counts and error counts. During incidents, logs help identify root causes and validate recovery."}
{"title": "Threat Modeling Lite: Assets, Threats, Controls", "url": "https://example.org/cyber/threat-modeling", "source": "Lab2-Cyber-Notes", "published_date": "2026-02-13", "text": "Threat modeling can be simplified to assets, threats, and controls. Assets are what you protect (documents, API keys, availability). Threats include unauthorized access, data poisoning, and denial of service. Controls reduce risk (edge auth, validation, least privilege, backups, and monitoring). Keeping Weaviate internal-only is a key control here."}
{"title": "RAG Safety: Grounding and Citations", "url": "https://example.org/cyber/rag-grounding", "source": "Lab2-Cyber-Notes", "published_date": "2026-02-13", "text": "RAG systems reduce hallucinations by grounding answers in retrieved documents. A safer chatbot returns citations (sources) and admits uncertainty when sources are insufficient. Prompt instructions should tell the model to use only the provided sources and avoid inventing details. In this lab, the API returns sources alongside the generated answer."}
